# Cellular-Automation
These projects were created as an assignment for my simulation modelling subject.
Elementary Cellular Automation supports 256 rules.
Two-dimensional Cellular Automation is basically the game of life.

The projects are created as Windows Form Applications. 
To make the grid, I implemented a Grid and a Cell class inside a PictureBox component.
